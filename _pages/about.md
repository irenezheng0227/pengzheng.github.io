About Me
======
I am a **master student of Analytics** in the department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at **University of California, Berkeley**. Previously, I obtained my **BSc in Computer Science** degree at **University of Liverpool** in United Kingdom with **GPA 3.96/4.0**. My research interests focus on **Reinforcement Learning**, especially deep RL in Multi-Agent Systems. I am looking for a one-year research intern (2023 Summer to 2024 Summer) before PhD application.

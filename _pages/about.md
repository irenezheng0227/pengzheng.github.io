I am a master student of Analytics in the department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) at University of California, Berkeley. Previously, I obtained my BSc in Computer Science degree at University of Liverpool in United Kingdom with GPA 3.96/4.0. My research interests focus on Reinforcement Learning, especially deep RL in Multi-Agent Systems. I am looking for a one-year research intern before PhD application.
